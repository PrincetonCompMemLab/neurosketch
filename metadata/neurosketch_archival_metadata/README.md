## README

- `neurosketch_demographics.csv`: information about the age and gender of each subject (using our anonymous naming scheme) in a file named 
- `neurosketch_trial_metadata`: onset and duration of each stimulus by experiment phase. The recog directory contains the same timing information in different formats that might be useful for different applications (e.g., object-based GLM, comparing run pairs, relating to other task variables). Most likely the most useful format is the .txt files in: `preproc_for_glm.`
- `neurosketch_procedure.txt`: that describes the task & procedure in plain prose.
